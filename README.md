# The Universal Transaction Protocol (UTP)
UTP is a shared set of communication standards for commercial transactions. UTP is an industry-agnostic, interoperable, open protocol connecting any buyer and any seller across any industry to engage in permissionless, location-aware transactions. 

## Developers
[The UTP specification](./docs/SPECIFICATION.md) defines a standard, technology-agnostic API description that allows any application to discover new commercial services without requiring api keys, source code access, additional documentation, or integrations with ad-hoc services. When properly defined, a software application can interpret and transact with remote services with a very minimal amount of implementation overhead.

Developers can use UTP to build new consumer marketplace applications without having to think about acquiring customers, hiring a sales team, or talking to a sales rep to acquire access to necessary infrastructure.
